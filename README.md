# Inkline

**Inkline** is a SaaS-inspired platform for managing workspaces, tasks, and collaborations—built as a production-grade playground to learn and experiment with full-stack development.  

## About Me

Hi! I’m **David Tuazon**, a final-year Computer Science student exploring MERN + TypeScript.
I’m passionate about building real-world applications and eager to sharpen my full-stack skills by creating production-grade systems.

## Key Goals
- Build a **SaaS-like platform** that mirrors production environments  
- Implement **multi-tenant workspaces** with owners, members, and roles  
- Practice **robust API design**, database modeling, and error handling  
- Integrate **frontend and backend** in a scalable, maintainable structure  
- Prepare a foundation for future features like notifications, analytics, and subscription plans  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express 
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Others:** Jest for testing, Axios for API calls

Inkline is still in development. Its primary purpose is learning and experimenting with real-world SaaS architecture while creating a fully functional, production-ready codebase.
